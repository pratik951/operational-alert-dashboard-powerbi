## 🚩 Problem → ✅ Solution → 📈 Impact

**Problem.** Ops/Sec teams drown in low-value noise; critical alerts are missed or delayed.

**Solution.** A scoring engine ranks alerts by **Severity × Frequency** with tunable weights. Analysts get a **Top-10 Triage** view, KPI cards, and an **Endpoint Heatmap** to spot hotspots fast.

**Impact (simulated on synthetic data).**
- ⏳ **Review time ↓ ~40%** using score-based triage
- 🧭 Root-cause visibility: identify top modules/endpoints producing noise
- 🧑‍💼 Better stakeholder decisions with clear KPIs & trends

> *Note: Impact is measured on synthetic data that mimics real-world patterns.*
